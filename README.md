# TheSoundMachine
Arduino code for The Sound Machine based on Roald Dahl short story

Based on Roald Dahl short story, this Arduino based machine will let you "hear" plant mood according to soil moisture.  
Even when sounds of course do not come from the plants but from mp3 recordings, the experience results revealing and gives you conscience 
about plants being alive and the suffering from water deprivation.

For the old version of this machine I've used:

Arduino Nano
FC28 sensor
7 segment display
Button
4 ohm speaker
DFPlayer mp3 player
MicroSD card
Custom case.

For the new version of this machine I've used:

Arduino Nano
FC28 sensor
2 Analog Vumeters
Button
Potentiometer
Led
4 ohm speaker
DFPlayer mp3 player
MicroSD card
Custom case.
